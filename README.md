# PatchBoot
This repository provides a guide for patching [AMI Aptio V UEFI firmware](https://www.ami.com/bios-uefi-utilities/) to circumvent [Secure Boot](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-secure-boot) checks and allow loading of unsigned executables.

## Disclamer
Flashing modified firmware onto your motherboard carries the risk of damaging it. On certain motherboards, **this damage could be irreparable**. Please proceed with caution - you have been warned.
